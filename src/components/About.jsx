I'm deeply passionate about leveraging my coding skills to create pixel-perfect websites. My current tech stacks for front-end development are React JS and Tailwind CSS. Apart from this, I code in JAVA. Currently, I am learning about UI/UX and making projects. The next few things on my checklist are Next js and Typescript. I am eager to work on projects that would help me showcase my full potential and strengths.  I really look forward to growing and nourishing my skills as a developer and excited to bring my skills to any opportunity that comes my way. </p>
